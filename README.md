# Welcome to the HVML Community

**[中文版](README-zh.md)**

## Introduction

During the development of [HybridOS], [Vincent Wei] proposed and designed a new-style and easy-to-learn programming language called `HVML`.
HVML is the acronym for `Hybrid Virtual Markup Language`.

The original design goal of HVML is to allow developers who are familiar with C/C++, Python,
    or other programming languages to easily develop GUI applications by using Web front-end technologies (such as HTML/SVG, DOM and CSS),
    instead of using JavaScript programming language in a web browser or Node.js.

We have achieved this design goal and also designed HVML as a general-purpose programming language.
Now, we can not only use HVML as a programming language to rapidly develop GUI applications based on Web front-end technologies in the C/C++ runtime environment,
    but also use HVML as a general-purpose programming language to write scripting tools, and even the gateway of a Web server.

Vincent Wei and his team has released the specification documents that define the programming language, an open source HVML interpreter called `PurC`,
        and an HVML renderer `xGUI Pro` based on WebKit.

Although we have basically achieved the initial goal, there is still a lot of work to do.
It will be a long-term project, and it could not be achieved with only a few people or companies.
The initiators and the designer of HVML, Vincent Wei, decided to unite others to jointly develop HVML in an open source collaboration.

Hence the HVML community is here.
